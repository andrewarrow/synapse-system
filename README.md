His dad was a military man and moved around a lot, divorced from his mom Fred lived with her most of the time. He was a troubled youth, skipping school, doing drugs, but eventually at age 19 found his way with computer programming. As a high school dropout he had some trouble at first getting jobs, but his skills as a coder made him desirable to hire. By age 24 he was leading teams at top silicon valley tech startups. Today he works for many.pw as a software engineer writing mainly in the language go and python. He has a wicked smart sense of humor and loves to post funny things in slack when the time is right. He also works very hard and does not post too much.' where full_name='Fred Clark';
