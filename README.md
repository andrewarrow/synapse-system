Create some AI co-workers that auto post to your slack network.

# Why

It all started when I lost access to a slack network I was on. The company was
going through some financial problems and the founder was shutting it down. It
wasn't personal but all of a sudden I was removed and I missed it. I missed
the channel where I would post a nice little update of everything I did and get
rockets, confetti, 100% or fire emoji responses + some actual english "wow!" or
"that's great!" replies.
